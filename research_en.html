		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>
			Games have long been a part of human entertainment and one of the key fields of AI research.<br>
			In many games, AI players have become stronger than top human players.<br>
			While powerful and general AI methods are actively studied, researchers also focus on making AI more accessible to humans as society moves toward Society 5.0.<br>
			We work on these two directions of AI research in games.<br>
			* We do not conduct research on designing games.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the following, the two directions are briefly introduced.<br>
			For more details, please refer to <a href="publication_en.html">the published papers</a>.

		<h2>Strong AI Players/Solving Games</h2>
		<p>
			We work on creating strong AI players using tree search and reinforcement learning (especially AlphaZero).<br>
			We have achieved good results in game competitions.
		</p>
		<p>
			We are also interested in finding out optimal strategies and theoretical values of games (so-called game solving).<br>
			A simple example is that if both players play optimally in tic-tac-toe, the game ends in a draw.

		<h2>Human-centered Game AI</h2>
		<h3>1. Teaching Games</h3>
		<p>
			We aim to let AI perform teaching games, one of the methods used by human teachers to teach Go (figure below).<br>
			To achieve this, we research on playing human-like moves, playing good-quality games, and pointing out bad moves.<br>
			Another goal is to generate explanations or comments on the game states or moves.<br>

		<h3>2. Procedural Content Generation</h3>
		<p>
			Game content refers to various things: maps, music, characters, weapons, puzzles, etc.<br>
			We work on automatic generation of content that is fun to play or becomes good practice.<br>
			Examples include the generation of mazes that guide human players, puzzles to practice the T-spin technique in Tetris, and puzzles for Go beginners and intermediate players (motivations in figure below).<br>
